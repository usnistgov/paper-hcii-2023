% For domain experts to benefit from advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), a new approach toward annotating and structuring technical text is required, driven by community development of new tools.
% We propose a user-centered approach to data labeling that aids in achieving what we term Technical Language Processing (TLP).
% We suggest a mapping between visual-information-seeking tasks and the problem of understanding, organizing, and annotating technical text.
% Further, we provide an overview of ongoing efforts to this end.
% Engagement from HCI and Human Factors community should be central to achieving what we see as fundamentally a form of Artificial Intelligence Augmentation (AIA), so that experts not only benefit from burgeoning algorithmic systems, but are able to trust the systems and the decisions they support.
